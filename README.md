This contains the source code for the jSparc JavaScript library, which
is used for a couple of web applications that can be found here:
[jSparc](http://data.hisparc.nl/media/jsparc/index.html).

This project is intended to provide tools for high school students to
work with HiSPARC data.

Documentation can be found here:
[jSparc docs](http://docs.hisparc.nl/jsparc/).


Analysis sessions
-----------------

A teacher can request a jSparc analysis session, when the server is done
generating the data the students can use the login code provided to the
teacher to start analysing coincidences (events detected by multiple
stations).


Data retrieval
--------------

A web application to easily download data, look into the data and make
many kinds of plots.


Event Display
-------------

Show the detection of station events and coincidences between stations
in real-time on a map.


Trigger simulation
------------------

A webpage that simulates HiSPARC III electronics for a 2 detector
station, flashing the trigger LED with an average event rate of 0.3 Hz.
